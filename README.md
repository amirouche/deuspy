# deuspy

Easy to Install. Easy to run. Easy to use.Database server to build prototypes.

## What?

You know aiohttp? At least you know requests? Meh... Let's just define a bunch
of helper functions.

### `/api/v0/create/`

### `/api/v0/read/{{ uid }}`

### `/api/v0/update/`

### `/api/v0/delete/{{ uid }}`

### `/api/v0/query/`

## How?

Magic!

## Why?

Because I can and because I need it. I want to present @ pyconfr 2018 a workshop 
around [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I don't want people
to feel bad at the very begining of their journey because they need to choose a
database. This. Is. For. Fun. And learn aiohttp. I don't want myself to have in
mind dozen of keywords form 3 or 4 different query languages each with their own
dialect to be able to help my fellow pythonistas achieve the asynchronous dream.

The idea is to have plain simple database server with which you can play with from
aiohttp.
